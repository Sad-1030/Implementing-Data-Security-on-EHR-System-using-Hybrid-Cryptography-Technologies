Your doctor may also take a throat culture, which involves swabbing the back of your throat. This test helps your doctor determine whether a bacterial infection is causing your sore throat. They may also order a blood test or chest X-ray to help rule out other potential causes of your symptoms. A chest X-ray will also show whether your cold has developed into a complication like bronchitis or pneumonia.

In certain cases, such as with a severe ear infection, your doctor may refer you or your child to a specialist such as an otolaryngologist. An otolaryngologist is a physician specially trained in treating the ear, nose, and throat (ENT).

Though there are some lab tests that can detect common viral agents like rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus, they are rarely used because the common cold tends to go away before a diagnostic test is necessary.
