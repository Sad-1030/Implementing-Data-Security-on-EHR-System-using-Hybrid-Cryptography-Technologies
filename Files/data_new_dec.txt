Abstract:In this project a new product rating approach for analyzing retail market of same type of products from different manufacturers is proposed In Asian retail market there is no specific customer rating record Instead, the retailers provide a feedback about the products based on the sales analysis By providing minimum threshold hypothesis using Product Rating Retail algorithm (PRR), retailers rating analysis is ranked In a retail business world, companies/manufacturers want to know about their products sales efficiency and its customer satisfaction To analyze the rating and ranking of such products by customer credit ratio the proposed algorithm evaluates loose coupling data mining in a randomized dataData mining, the extraction of hidden predictive information from large databases, is a powerful new technology with great potential to help companies focus on the most important information in their data warehouses Data mining tools predict future trends and behaviors, allowing businesses to make proactive, knowledge-driven decisions The automated, prospective analyses offered by data mining move beyond the analyses of past events provided by retrospective tools typical of decision support systems Data mining tools can answer business questions that traditionally were too time consuming to resolve Data mining techniques can be implemented rapidly on existing software and hardware platforms to enhance the value of existing information resources, and can be integrated with new products and systems as they are brought on-line When implemented on high performance client/server or parallel processing computers, data mining tools can analyze massive databases to deliver answers to questions such as, "Which clients are most likely to respond to my next promotional mailing, and why?"Data mining (DM), also called Knowledge-Discovery in Databases (KDD) or Knowledge-Discovery and Data Mining, is the process of automatically searching large volumes of data for patterns using tools such as classification, association rule mining, clustering, etc Data mining is a complex topic and has links with multiple core fields such as computer science and adds value to rich seminal computational techniques from statistics, information retrieval, machine learning and pattern recognition
